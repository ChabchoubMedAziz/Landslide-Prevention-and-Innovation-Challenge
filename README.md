# Landslide-Prevention-and-Innovation-Challenge
This repository contains the code for the Landslide Prevention and Innovation Challenge. The challenge is part of the Zindi Competetion.
It is an ensemble of XGB and LightGBM trained on 10 stratified folds with oversampling method for the data imbalance problem and some threshold variations. It has a score of 0.761 on the private LB but was not one of my 2 best public LB scores
